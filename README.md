# TASK OVERVIEW
    • Create a web application based on two components: an Angular based frontend and a Java based backend
    • The backend component should provide a REST API to manage a list of ATMs in a given Dutch city and return a well formed JSON response
    • The data used by the application should be retrieved from an external service and kept in memory: https://www.dropbox.com/s/6fg0k2wxwrheyqk/ATMs?dl=1
    • The frontend component should be made of a simple page that shows the list of ATMs with a search box on top (full text search on all fields)
    • Use a mainstream framework for the Java component, such as Spring, Micronaut, Dropwizard, Quarkus etc. 
    • Use a build tool, such as Maven or Gradle

# BONUS FEATURES

    • Use a Bootstrap template for the frontend component
    • Use of Apache Camel to route the web service call
    • Secure the page with Spring security
    • Unit tests using JUnit
    • English Markdown documentation

# EXPECTED OUTPUT

    • Upload the sources for the two projects to your Github or Gitlab account and share the URLs
    • Provide two shell scripts to run both the components with no hassle, i.e. without dependencies on application server or other software to be installed
    • Write a document explaining the solution and how it was implemented (English language)
